var text = ["What is abstinence?","Abstinence refers to the practice of voluntarily choosing to refrain from certain behaviors, activities, or substances. This is often in the context of abstaining from things like alcohol, drugs, or sexual activity. People might choose abstinence for personal, religious, health, or moral reasons. For example, sexual abstinence typically means not engaging in sexual activity, while abstaining from alcohol means choosing not to drink alcoholic beverages.","Is abstinence the best form of birth control?","Abstinence is the only 100% effective method for preventing unplanned pregnancies and STDs, but it is not always practical or realistic, especially for individuals in consensual sexual relationships or for those who experience sexual assault, where the choice is taken away. Condoms are 85% effective (98% with perfect use) and protect against both pregnancy and most STDs, while birth control pills are 91% effective (99% with perfect use) at preventing pregnancy but donâ€™t protect against STDs. For many, combining contraception methods like condoms and birth control offers a more feasible, effective solution for preventing pregnancy and STDs.","How does it impact the areas of wellness?","Abstinence benefits physical wellness by completely eliminating the risks of unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). It helps individuals avoid the potential health complications that can arise from sexual activity, such as infections like HIV, chlamydia, or unintended pregnancies. By refraining from sex, individuals protect their bodies from these risks, promoting long-term physical health. Abstinence may not provide protection against unintended consequences like sexual assault or coercion, where individuals lose control over their choice. Additionally, for those who choose abstinence as a lifestyle, it may limit their ability to develop safe sexual practices and educate themselves about contraception and sexual health. <br>&emsp;Abstinence can support emotional wellness by allowing individuals to build deeper, non-sexual connections in relationships. It removes the complexities and emotional stress that sometimes come with sexual involvement, providing more space for emotional growth and personal development. However, for some individuals, the choice to remain abstinent can lead to frustration, feelings of isolation, or emotional distress if they feel their personal desires are at odds with societal expectations or pressures. It may also create stress in romantic relationships if partners have different views on sexual intimacy. <br>&emsp;Abstinence can positively influence social wellness by reducing the pressures and potential conflicts that arise from sexual relationships, such as unwanted attention or relationship drama. It can help individuals stay true to their values and avoid social complications. On the other hand, it may also lead to social exclusion or feeling disconnected from peers who are sexually active, especially in environments where sexual activity is normalized. This may cause an individual to feel left out or misunderstood in social situations, leading to potential social anxiety or tension in relationships."];
